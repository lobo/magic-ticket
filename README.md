Magic Ticket for Zendesk
============

This script checks the date in a specified column of a Google spreadsheet to see if it's X amount of days away. If it is X amount of days or less, the script uses it's granted authorization to open a Zendesk ticket with the corresponding row of information. It uses an additional Log spreadsheet (add as a tabbed sheet) to log the results.
